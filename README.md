# Card album organizer

The objective of this project is to provide an easy to use tool to be able to organize your cards from your favourite trading card game into your album.

When the album has lots of cards, it's easier to spot where your card should be placed, but when you start a new collection it's a bit more complicated and more prone to errors.

With this tool, you will be able to configure your album and see where the cards should go with ease.

## Configure your album grid

You can configure how many rows and columns your album has. This will allow the application to calculate where your card should be placed.

## Search by card number

Enter the card number into the search box, and the application will tell you how many page turns you must do, in which page and in which slot the card goes, and also if the page is on the left or right side.

If you enable the **relative search**, it will tell you how many page turns you must perform from where you are right now (your last searched card), so you don't have to go back to the beginning of the album and count again all the page turns each time.
